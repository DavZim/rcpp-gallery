 * @summary This example illustrate a popular MCMC sampler
 *
 * Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) is a popular simulation method. As
 * it is somewhat demanding, it is also frequently used to benchmark
 * different implementations or algorithms.
 *
 * One particular algorithm has been compared a number of times, starting
 * [with an article by Darren Wilkinson](http://darrenjw.wordpress.com/2010/04/28/mcmc-programming-in-r-python-java-and-c/),
 * and [Darren's follow--up article](http://darrenjw.wordpress.com/2011/07/16/gibbs-sampler-in-various-languages-revisited/)
 * which in turns responded in part to
 * [our article](http://dirk.eddelbuettel.com/blog/2011/07/14/).
 *
 * This post simply refreshes the implementation using Rcpp attributes.
 *
 * First we look at the R version, and its byte-compiled variant.

## Here is the actual Gibbs Sampler
## This is Darren Wilkinsons R code (with the corrected variance)
Rgibbs <- function(N,thin) {
    mat <- matrix(0,ncol=2,nrow=N)

/**
 * Creating a version in C++ is very straightforward thanks to Rcpp and
 * Rcpp Attributes. It transfers the integer arguments `n` (number of
 * simulations) and `thn` (number of extra thinning simulations),
 * initializes the R random number generator for us (eg no need to manual
 * nstantiate the `RNGScope` object), and returns the result matrix
 *
 * Also, since the initial posts were written, we made the (scalar) RNGs
 * of the R API available directly via the `R` namespace. This is both
 * little nice to read than the poor-man's pseudo-namespace in C via the
 * `Rf_` prefix, and actually provides proper C++ namespace.
